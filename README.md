# cset
MFC-styled set container

As far as I know, MFC doesn't supply a set container out of the box, hence why I decided to roll out my own. It uses a CMap as its underlying data structure, and it's thus hash-based.

Feel free to use it in your projects as desired; all you need to do is include the "Set.h" file and you're all set (pun intended)!
